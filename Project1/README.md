#  Project1: Nanjing Housing Price Prediction

## Given history data：

Year X = [2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013]

Price y = [2.000, 2.500, 2.900, 3.147, 4.515, 4.903, 5.365, 5.704, 6.853, 7.971, 8.561, 10.000, 11.280, 12.900]

## Assumption:

the price and year are in a linear relation, thus they could be modeled by linear regression

## Task：

To get the relationship of X and y by using linear regression, based on 1) close-form solution and 2) gradient descent;
To predict the Nanjing housing price in 2014.
